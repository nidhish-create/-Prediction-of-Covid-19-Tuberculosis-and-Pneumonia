# RespiraDetectX
A project to predict Covid-19 , Pneumonia and Tuberculosis by looking through x-ray images and using Deep Learning.

# OBJECTIVE
Early diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases is critical to prevent complications including
death. Lung diseases cause respiratory distress. Through early detection and identification of
lung diseases a person’s life can be saved using different clinical techniques. We breathe in air
with the help of our lungs. Our Lungs get filled with oxygen and it is distributed in the blood
and all our body cells require oxygen to grow but people with lung disorders have had difficulty
in breathing which in turn directly affect their health. There are certain symptoms like
coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath which can give us an early hint as to whether our lungs
are properly functioning or not. The doctor in some cases suggests a patient to get blood tests,
sputum tests and chest X-rays to get more information about the patient and to know about the
patient’s disease in detail. Chest X-rays are one of the methods for diagnosis, playing a crucial
role in clinical care. Artificial Intelligence is finding many applications in our daily life from
online shopping, web searching to disease detection. Machine Learning which is a subset of
Artificial Intelligence helps us do that.

# TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION
# Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is an interactive web-based computational environment for authoring Jupyter
notebook pages. Depending on the context, the term "notebook" can refer to a variety of things,
including the Jupyter online application, Jupyter Python web server, or Jupyter document
format. A Jupyter Notebook document is a JSON document with an ordered collection of
input/output cells that can contain code, text (using Markdown), mathematics, graphs, and rich
media, and typically ends with the ".ipynb" extension.
# Google Colab
Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that is free to use. Many common
machine learning libraries are supported by Colab and can be quickly loaded into your
notebook. Python code can be written and executed using Google Colab.
# Python Libraries
# Numpy
NumPy is a Python library that adds support for huge, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices,
as well as a large number of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
# Seaborn
Seaborn is a Python module for creating statistical visuals. Seaborn assists you in exploring
and comprehending your data. Its charting functions work with dataframes and arrays
containing entire datasets, performing the necessary semantic mapping and statistical
aggregation internally to generate useful graphs.
# Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a Python package that allows you to create static, animated, and interactive
visualisations. Matplotlib creates high-quality figures in a range of hardcopy and interactive
formats for a variety of platforms.
# Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn (previously scikits-learn, and also known as sklearn) is a free Python machine
learning package. It includes support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-
21
means, and DBSCAN, among other classification, regression, and clustering techniques, and
is designed to work with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
# TensorFlow
TensorFlow is a machine learning software library that is free and open-source. It can be used
for a variety of applications, but it focuses on deep neural network training and inference.
TensorFlow is a dataflow and differentiable programming-based symbolic math toolkit.
# Keras
Keras is a Python-based deep learning API that runs on top of TensorFlow, a machine learning
platform. It was created with the goal of allowing for quick experimentation. It's crucial to be
able to go from idea to result as quickly as feasible when conducting research.
