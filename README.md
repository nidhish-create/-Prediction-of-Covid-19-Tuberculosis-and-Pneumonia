# RespiraDetectX
A project to predict Covid-19 , Pneumonia and Tuberculosis by looking through x-ray images and using Deep Learning.
important libraries - Tensorflow, matplotlib, seaborn
requirements - jupyter notebook, colab

# Objective
Early diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases is critical to prevent complications including
death. Lung diseases cause respiratory distress. Through early detection and identification of
lung diseases a person’s life can be saved using different clinical techniques. We breathe in air
with the help of our lungs. Our Lungs get filled with oxygen and it is distributed in the blood
and all our body cells require oxygen to grow but people with lung disorders have had difficulty
in breathing which in turn directly affect their health. There are certain symptoms like
coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath which can give us an early hint as to whether our lungs
are properly functioning or not. The doctor in some cases suggests a patient to get blood tests,
sputum tests and chest X-rays to get more information about the patient and to know about the
patient’s disease in detail. Chest X-rays are one of the methods for diagnosis, playing a crucial
role in clinical care. Artificial Intelligence is finding many applications in our daily life from
online shopping, web searching to disease detection. Machine Learning which is a subset of
Artificial Intelligence helps us do that.
